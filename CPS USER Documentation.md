Certainly! Let's provide more detailed explanations for each Challenge Point System along with extended examples:

### Challenge Point Systems Explained:

1. **Constant Points System (CS):**
   - **Description:** Every solver receives a fixed number of points regardless of their position.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 100,
       "3rd": 100,
       ...
     }
     ```

2. **Linear Decrease System (LI):**
   - **Description:** Points decrease linearly as the solver's position increases, creating a straight-line progression.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 95,
       "3rd": 90,
       ...
     }
     ```

3. **Percentage Decrease System (PC):**
   - **Description:** Points decrease exponentially based on a percentage, leading to a rapid decrease.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 90,
       "3rd": 81,
       ...
     }
     ```

4. **Exponential Decrease System (EX):**
   - **Description:** Points decrease exponentially, with each solver's position getting a fraction of the previous points.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 50,
       "3rd": 25,
       ...
     }
     ```

5. **Quadratic Decrease System (QD):**
   - **Description:** Points decrease quadratically as the solver's position increases, leading to an increasing rate of decrease.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 96,
       "3rd": 81,
       ...
     }
     ```

6. **Bonus-Malus System (BM):**
   - **Description:** Bonus for odd positions, malus for even positions, creating an alternating pattern.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 105,
       "2nd": 95,
       "3rd": 110,
       ...
     }
     ```

7. **High-Medium-Low System (HM):**
   - **Description:** Different points assigned for the top, middle, and bottom positions, catering to three tiers.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 120,
       "5th": 100,
       "10th": 80,
       ...
     }
     ```

8. **Randomized Points System (RC):**
   - **Description:** Points are randomly assigned to each position, introducing an element of unpredictability.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 82,
       "2nd": 105,
       "3rd": 93,
       ...
     }
     ```

9. **Fixed Steps System (FS):**
   - **Description:** Points decrease in fixed steps as the solver's position increases, maintaining a consistent progression.
   - **Example:**
     ```json
     {
       "1st": 100,
       "2nd": 95,
       "3rd": 90,
       ...
     }
     ```

10. **Geometric Progression System (GP):**
    - **Description:** Points form a geometric progression, with each position getting a fraction of the previous.
    - **Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "1st": 100,
        "2nd": 50,
        "3rd": 25,
        ...
      }
      ```

11. **Odd-Even System (OC):**
    - **Description:** Odd positions receive a bonus, even positions get a malus, leading to an alternating pattern.
    - **Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "1st": 105,
        "2nd": 95,
        "3rd": 110,
        ...
      }
      ```

12. **Descending Steps System (DS):**
    - **Description:** Points decrease in descending steps, creating a progressively steeper decrease.
    - **Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "1st": 100,
        "2nd": 95,
        "3rd": 90,
        ...
      }
      ```

13. **Uniform Steps System (US):**
    - **Description:** Points decrease uniformly in fixed steps as the solver's position increases, maintaining consistency.
    - **Example:**
      ```json
      {
        "1st": 100,
        "2nd": 95,
        "3rd": 90,
        ...
      }
      ```
