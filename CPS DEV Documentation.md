### Challenge Point Systems Documentation

The `CHALLENGE_POINT_SYSTEMS` list includes various systems to calculate points for solvers based on their position in a challenge. Each system has a unique code associated with it.

#### 1. Constant Points System (CS)
- Description: Points remain constant for all positions.
- Usage: `CS` is suitable for challenges where each solver receives the same number of points regardless of their position.

#### 2. Linear Decrease System (LI)
- Description: Points decrease linearly as the solver's position increases.
- Usage: `LI` is suitable for challenges where higher positions receive fewer points in a linear fashion.

#### 3. Percentage Decrease System (PC)
- Description: Points decrease exponentially based on a percentage.
- Usage: `PC` is suitable for challenges where points decrease exponentially with each solver's position.

#### 4. Exponential Decrease System (EX)
- Description: Points decrease exponentially with each solver's position.
- Usage: `EX` is suitable for challenges where a rapid decrease in points for lower positions is desired.

#### 5. Quadratic Decrease System (QD)
- Description: Points decrease quadratically as the solver's position increases.
- Usage: `QD` is suitable for challenges where points decrease at an increasing rate with each position.

#### 6. Bonus-Malus System (BM)
- Description: Bonus for odd positions, Malus for even positions.
- Usage: `BM` is suitable for challenges where alternating bonus and malus points are assigned based on solver positions.

#### 7. High-Medium-Low System (HM)
- Description: Different points for the top, middle, and bottom positions.
- Usage: `HM` is suitable for challenges where different points are assigned based on solver positions, such as top, middle, and bottom.

#### 8. Randomized Points System (RC)
- Description: Points are randomly assigned to each position.
- Usage: `RC` is suitable for challenges where randomness is desired in assigning points to solver positions.

#### 9. Fixed Steps System (FS)
- Description: Points decrease in fixed steps as the solver's position increases.
- Usage: `FS` is suitable for challenges where points decrease in a fixed step-wise manner with each position.

#### 10. Geometric Progression System (GP)
- Description: Points form a geometric progression.
- Usage: `GP` is suitable for challenges where points decrease in a geometric progression based on a common ratio.

#### 11. Odd-Even System (OC)
- Description: Odd positions get a bonus, even positions get a malus.
- Usage: `OC` is suitable for challenges where alternating bonus and malus points are assigned based on solver positions (odd and even).

#### 12. Descending Steps System (DS)
- Description: Points decrease in descending steps.
- Usage: `DS` is suitable for challenges where points decrease in steps, with the step size increasing for each position.

#### 13. Uniform Steps System (US)
- Description: Points decrease in uniform steps as the solver's position increases.
- Usage: `US` is suitable for challenges where points decrease uniformly in fixed steps with each position.

Feel free to choose the system that best fits the dynamics of your challenges. You can extend this list with additional systems as needed.
